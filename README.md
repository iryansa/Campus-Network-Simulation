# **Campus Network Simulation - Multi-Building Networking Project**

This repository contains the configuration files, screenshots, and documentation for a **Campus Network Simulation** project. The project involves the design and implementation of a multi-building campus network with key features including:

- **Dynamic IP Allocation (DHCP):** Automatically assigns IP addresses to end devices across multiple subnets.
- **VLANs:** Segregates network traffic within buildings for enhanced performance and organization.
- **Routing (RIP):** Ensures seamless communication between buildings and subnets.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Provides internet access to devices in private networks.

## **Features**
1. **Scalable Network Design**: Supports multiple buildings with unique subnets.
2. **Dynamic Addressing**: Simplifies IP management using DHCP pools.
3. **Traffic Isolation**: Implements VLANs for secure and efficient intra-building communication.
4. **Inter-Building Connectivity**: Enables routing between subnets using RIP.
5. **Internet Access**: Configures NAT for external communication.

## **Contents**
- **Configuration Files**: Router and switch configurations for the network setup.
- **Implementation Details**: Screenshots and step-by-step explanations of configurations.
- **Testing Results**: Evidence of successful pings, DHCP leases, and NAT translations.
- **Documentation**: Full project report detailing objectives, implementation, and outcomes.
